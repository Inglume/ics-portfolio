<h1> Who am I? </h1>
<p> My name is Nicholas Glenn and I'm a grade 10 student at William Lyon Mackenzie. I enjoy listening to music. At
    school, I'm part of the Computer Programming Club where I attend lessons, work on problems on online judges, and
    participate in computer programming competitions. </p>

<p> On my github, you'll be able to find all of my ICS projects listed in my past projects, including the source for
    this website! </p>

<p> In my spare time, I like to solve problems on WLMOJ, a clone of DMOJ made for the school of William Lyon Mackenzie.
    I use WLMOJ more than DMOJ because it's what I was exposed to at first and I get to compete head-on with others at
    my school. I find that doing competitive programming is a very good way for me to practice writing code and is very
    helpful for honing my problem-solving skills. </p>
<h2> My Personality </h2>
<p> According to the Humanmetrics Jung Typology Test, I am an INTP, which stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking,
    and Perceiving. I agree that I am introverted. I do not like being around large groups of people, and tend to stick
    to a few people. I am intuitive rather than sensing, I like to see the world in an abstract sense and in the greater
    picture rather than focusing on little detailed things. For the thinking component, I am able to handle my emotions
    well. All the decisions I are rather objective, I have good self-control with what I spend my money on or what I
    eat. However, I feel that I can still relate and be sympathetic to others in hard times. Additionally, I agree that
    I am perceiving. Some people know already what their purpose in life it, whereas I don't want to put all my eggs in
    one basket. I'd rather keep an open mind about what I could do in life and have a broad perspective on the world. </p>
<p> According to humanmetrics.com, INTPs are supposed to be detached from reality. I believe that I can be like that
    sometimes. I don't like to learn about what is happening in the present rather than things in general. I prefer to
    read about concepts and ideas rather than current events in the world. The physical world of politics doesn't
    interest me as much as the theoretical world of philosophy does. </p>
<p> This may be why I enjoy math and computer science, I like learning about theories rather than more practical things
    such as history or literature. These subjects are more imaginative and thought-provoking in my opinion. </p>
<p> INTPs are also supposed to be obsessed with logical correctness. This aligns with me as well. I don't usually make
    as many errors with logic as I do with making small mistakes in a large solution or misinterpreting the question. </p>
